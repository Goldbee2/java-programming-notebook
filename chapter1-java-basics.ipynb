    "The majority of you may have taken CSCI 141 prior to taking this course. As a result, we will start introducing Java by comparing some key differences between Python (the language you learned in CSCI 141) and Java. If you have little coding experience in Python, you can still get a sense of programming paradigm in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major difference between Python and Java is that Java is a statically typed and Python is a dynamically typed. In other words, when you write code in Python, you don't need to define data types when initializing or declaring variables or functions. However, you must do so in Java. For instance, if you want to declare an integer variable with value as 5 and print it out, we need to do this in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int var = 5;\n",
    "System.out.println(var);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"int\" is the data type of variable named var, and it has to be specified before the appearance of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major difference lies in the supported programming paradigm. Python supports functional, imperative, and procedural programming paradigms. Java was designed as an object-oriented, concurrent, and class-based programming language. Although Java has been evolving and started supporting lambda expression since Java 8, it is still considered an object-oriented language by most developers. For a better understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, please refer to Section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some small syntactical differences include semicolon and denoting code blocks. Every statement in Java needs to end with a semicolon. For instance, if you want to declare an integer variable with value as 5, increment it by 3, and print it out, we need to do this in Java:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int var = 5;\n",
    "var = var + 3;\n",
    "System.out.println(var);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses whitespaces to denote code blocks, while Java uses brackets to denote code blocks. For instance, if we want to declare an integer variable with value as 5, keep incrementing it by 3 for 10 times using a while loop, and print it out, we need to do this in Java:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int var = 5;\n",
    "int i = 0;\n",
    "while (i < 10) {\n",
    "  var = var + 3;\n",
    "  i = i + 1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "System.out.println(var);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The followings are some code samples (including the above ones) you may want to play with. Note that multiple code sections are oganized in one code cell, so you may need to keep one section uncommented each time when you run it."
